# Farey-Algorithm
Function of two variables x and y. 
Takes a number x as input then uses the Farey algorithm to find a rational approximation of x.
y is the number of times the loop runs and thus is directly related to the accuracy of the approximation.
The more times the loop runs the closer the approximation will be however run time can increase fairly rapidly as y increases.
